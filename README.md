# Vercel Plugin for Flow Launcher

This plugin allows you to search for projects and deployments. I's based on Vercel Raycast Extension.

## Requirements

To run this plugin you need to have Node.js installed. You can download a portable zip version of Node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/, then set the path to the portable Node.js in node.bat

The modules used in this plugin are kept in the node_modules folder.
